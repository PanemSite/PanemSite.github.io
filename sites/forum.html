          Hey everyone, regardless of who won the games now, what would be your team mates of choice? Let's say you can pick up to three and you need to shortly describe why.

            Well frankly this is hard to answer if you know who won the games. But at the beginning I already knew that that girl Katniss used to call "Foxface" when she spoke to Peeta, would definitely have to be on my side. Why? Well you could really see how suprised other tributes, mostly Katniss, were when they saw her really smart moves. For example hiding in the cornucopia. But I am not sure if she would cheat me some day. Then next there would be Rue. She knows so much about herbs, roots and berries and in addition, can move super quietly. That way food would be guaranteed. If you are in the suitable environment of course. I also would want Cato in my team. He is a very strong person I would not want to have as an enemy. But in the end, you will of course need to fight them :/

            I wouldn't chose an ally at all. You really don't know if they stay faithful to me.

            I guess mine is one of the best. It's in the side street of the training center building.

            I am a big fan of the coffe you get served as Gamemaker in the training Centre. And some here may know I spent a few years there.
