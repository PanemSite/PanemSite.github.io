    <h1>Interview</h1>

    <div class="maintext">
      <p>
        Read our latest interview with an inhabitant from district 12!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Nice to have you here, Madam! You are from district 12, the district that is rated as the poorest in existence. Would you mind giving us your name?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>
        Hey Sir, my name is Miranda Summer, but you can just call me Summer if you want.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of this District being called a "Junkyard" by many wealthier Districts, do you think there is something that makes your District stand out from the crowd?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>
        Well that is hard to answer. But the most adorable thing about our district is the fact that we all work togehter to make the best out of our situation. We respect each other and don't try to beat others in wealth. But next to that, being the poorest district <em>does</em> in fact give us an advantage. Image two people being in a deadly environment and one of them was feeded with the most valuable food one could find and the other one has got to know how to really hunger and find food in any environment. The winner is obvious.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, Summer I would agree but the last time your district won is decades in the past...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>
        The unlucky thing is that our district may be trained in the mentioned things but not in fighting and hunting. Fortunately somtimes there are people who, let's say, <em>stretch</em> the law a bit. You know, discovering the forest.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Have you just told us a secret that could get you in trouble?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>
        No that is no secret. But they do not really care that much. <em>Yes</em>, you will get arrested if you get caught but they do not search for these people.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine being choosen as a tribute. Would you let us know your strategies?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      <h3>Answer</h3>
      <p>
        Haha sure I will. I am allready too old to be choosen but I took my time to think of a suitable plan. The time my name was in the bowl, I was the most athletic person in our school. Not just in running but also in fighting. And so I would not try to get a good wepon from the middle, but eliminate others in face-to-face fights. In that case a bow or a gun is no advantage at all. Once the area is a bit more clear, I would search for a long distance weapon and a knive. And the rest is just surviving, what we are skilled in.
