    <div class="about">
      This is district 12. The mining District. We would say we are wealthy, but we would also say it is not nice to lie. We would, however say that we are the poorest district and everyone will agree. We've got at terrible electric fence trying to keep out the dangerous animals or, more likely, trying to keep us inside. We said "electrict fence". Well sorry but that is a lie. It is powered for around 2 hours per day as if it would be too expensive for the capitol to get us a working fence. No hard feelings, Capitol, no hard feelings. Our tributes for this year are "Peeta Mallarck" and "Katniss Everdeen", a volunteer. Sadly the last time we won was a long time ago, but this time we have a good feeling to win again!

      <h3>Frequently asked questions about D12</h3>

      <div class="post">
        Why did Katniss volunteer? This does not happen that often here.
        <div class="answer">
          Because otherwise it would have been her sister, and she did not want her to die there.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="post">
        Are there tips for surviving here?
        <div class="answer">
          Yes! NEVER go beyond that fence, always be there at the reaping day and never get in trouble with the peacekeepers. Then everything should be allright.

      <div class="post">
        Is there hope for a new fence?
        <div class="answer">
          The problem is that this district dows not get as much attention as we would like to. Maybe if someone will win for us, we may be able to get a working one.

      <div class="post">
        What is the least dangerous job there?
        <div class="answer">
          Let's start with the <em>most</em> dangerous first, and that is definitely the miner. So may people died there because of explosions and other accidents. Way more peaceful is the farmer. You just work on the big grain field that no one relly controlls, harvest and plant.
