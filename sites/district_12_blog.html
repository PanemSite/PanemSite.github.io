        Now everyone knows the connection between me and Katniss. It is a terrible feeling. Tomorrow we will leave the capitol to go to the arena. Then we won't be able to upload posts here anymore but instead we can use the new "virtual diary" feature. A nice idea, but I wonder if anyone will have the time to do this. If I'm not instantly slaught after the start, find a safe spot and have time, I will of course do it.

        I've just had my "restyling"... And it was fantastic. Also it was quite painful. These stylists are a mixture of very friendly, funny and cute. However, there was also a new guy, who designed our costume. And as we all know the audience went completely insane about it. We now have to see if we can still use this blog once we are in our appartements, aka prison :(

        We are slowly approaching the Capitol. We had to leave the train to go the rest by car as there are no railways in the city. There are so many people watching us and this whole place is just amazing! It is such a modern environment full of huge buildings, lights and many many colors.

        We are now on the railway to the Capitol. I can not imagine to have ever had that much food. So both me and Peeta ate as much as we could because we never know when we will have the possibility to eat again xD. We also had some troubles with our tutor. In the end we had to make a "deal" that we would allow him to drink if helped us and wouldn't do it all the time. Maybe that gave him the idea to reveal his master hint: to stay alive.

        At the justice Building we could say our probably last words to our friends and our family. I had never seen a building this clean and luxurious. It had a comfortable chair and a very soft couch. After that we were picked up by the guards to go to the train, where we will meet Effie again.
