        It's done! WE DID IT!!! But it was a hard final. When we were at the lake, at first everything seemed just so peaceful. I sang along with the mockingjays and we refilled our water. But when the sun slowly set, Cato was crashing out of the bush. Not to chase us, but to be chased by a mob of Muttations. It was horrorfying. They looked like wolves, but could walk on two legs and later on we even noticed they were made out of the dead tributes! Our only possibility was to climb up the cornucopia and defend it against them. What made it hard was that we still had to fight Cato but he was in his own trouble. Also these things were quite intelligent. They tryied many attacks and several formations but in the end did not succeed reaching to us up there. But then Cato grabbed Peeta and put his arm around his neck, so that if I shoot him, he would also kill Peeta. Then Peeta used his fingernails to make a mark on Catos hand and before he could even react I shot through his hand. Then the Mutts grabbed him and slowly tore him apart in the cornucopia. I could only image what pain he was in so I shot an arrow through his head to redeem him. <br><br>

        Now always notice the following hint: never, really <b>NEVER</b> put trust in any of the gamemakers "rule changes". We thought we could win together but then they changed it again! What fools we were.. we should have seen it from the announcement on. It would have been a great final for the audience. Peeta wanted me to kill him so he simulated as if he wanted to stab me with his knive. But noone of us could do this. Then we had a better Idea. A punch in the Capitols face: no winners. But right after we took the last poisonous berries in our mouths, Claudius congratulated us to our win and we spat them out again immediately.<br><br>

        Peeta got his leg cured in the Traning-Center-building although he now has a metal rod instead of a fully functional one :(<br><br>

        Soon we will leave to see our families again. I just can't wait!

        Ah, foolish! Why did we think these guys from above would make it that easy?! Over night they just dried out our river. Obviously, they want us to go to our probably final station - the lake.

        Peeta's cured but also Thresh got killed. And apparently Foxface, too. Peeta was picking berries and searching for roots when he took some very poisonous berries with him. Foxface must have watched him, because she ate them and immediately died. And Thresh was probably killed by Cato, the last Problem we need to take care of now...<br>
        But until there is better things to do, we will just hold on to that "star-crossed-lover" story.

        Yes, I did it! But not without struggeling. I was there, hiding and waiting for something to happen. I knew that one of those packages in front of the cornucopia was for me/us. Then suddenly the Foxface girl ran out the cornucopia and disapeared with her package. Damn she was smart. But it would have been smarter to destroy or steal the other packages. Now was the time for me but then I was attacked from behind by Clove. She must have really hated me because she wanted to kill me in kind of a bloody "ceremony". Bad for her, because that way she didn't notice Thresh coming from behind. He killed her by crushing her skull with a rock. He thought Clove killed his partner, rue. But when I told him the truth, he let me go. That now we are no longer owed. That was actually very smart.. I think if I killed someone who saved Peeta I would definetely regret that. Not that I wouldn't regret any of this brutal stuff

        Well, I guess I do not need to re-tale the whole thing with the syrup because I am sure everyone saw it. But I'll do it anyway for later generations. So Claudius announced the feast at the cornucopia and I was sure there was something for Peetas leg. But he denied me from goiing there but Haymitch had other plans for me so he sent me some leep-syrup I gave to Peeta. He immediately fell asleep and now I can finally go to the feast.

        I found him. And Cato did a GREAT job completely destroying his leg. I went back to roughly around where Peeta fought Cato. I knew he injured his leg so he wouldn't be able to move around much and therefor would have to stay near a river or a lake. And I knew there was a river very close. And so I went up the river until I stumbled across some rocks. He wouldn't be able to climb over these but there I also found some bloodstains and followed them. They ended in nowhere, but suddenly I heard a voice under me. And there he was. Completely camouflaged under leaves, branches and dirt.

        Well, I hope it is true and they can't read this here. But I am really, REALLY mad at the capitol. I now understand what Peeta ment when he said "we are just a part of their games. Not individuals". And it is true. They don't care at all, but see us as puppets that do what ever they please for. Long story short - rue is dead. She got trapped by District 1s male tribute and killed with a spear in her stomach. It was a sad and enraging moment. That was when I understood Peetas words. And so I wanted to show that to the viewers and decorated her with flowers and sang her a song before she was picked up. Now I had to go on alone.<br>
        But then the unexpected happened out of nowhere. Claudius Templesmith made an announcement and told us about the first big change in the rules. Now there can be <em>two</em> winners if they are from the same district! I know I HAVE to win for rue and for that I need Peeta. I allready have an Idea where to find him...<br>

        A lot has happened. I went through a firestorm that has injured my hands very hard. Fortunately, I seem to have quite rich sponsors because they sent me some medicine that instantley cured it. That was while I was trapped on a tree with rue. At night we then used my knive to cut of a tracker-jackers nest (Very dangerous wasps, with hallucinating poison) and threw it down to the careers that set up a camp down there. That way I got my hands to a bow and arrows, although I got stung 3 times. But Rue knew some leaves that could cure these stings. An other interesting thing was that Peeta warned me that I should run away from them. I think he somehow wanted to help me. Well, I think they will execute him for that. Rues and my Plan is now to destroy their food supplies, to get them in real trouble. They are from the rich districts, so I doubt they know how to hunger >:)<br>

        So without too much self praise, it is really helpful to always have an ace on your hand. In this case our intelligence and a knive.

        Damn. Peeta is with the careers. It seems like they want useful information from him. But hint: never let anyone notive you are discouraged or unsettled or you might immediately loose sponsors as they see you as a weakling

        I highly recommend paying attention when the announcement in the sky about the killed tributes comes. This results a lot of useful information, eg. knowing about others powers and abilities. And, well that's obvious, you are always informed about who is still alive and who not.

        I finally got the possibility to upload my first hints. I almost stumbled over a courierpatrol. They <em>are</em> easy to recognize. So I gave them my first notes what to do when the games start (This text up here is btw written by the courier service).<br>
        It really depends on your personal skills. First I saw a bow and arrows lying around 30 feet away from my position and a small package just a few meters away from me. My first Idea was to grab the bow and run as fast as I can towards the forest. I think this would be a good Idea if you can run fast <em>and</em> are good at face-to-face fights with those hardcore trained killing-machines. As this is not true for me, I immediately grabbed the small package in front of me and ran into the forset. And there you have it again: even if you think some stuff in the middle would be more useful, it's the small things that safe your life. A girl threw a knife after me, but it got stuck in my backpack. Now I've got a perfect weapon without having to go to the middle or the "cornucopia".

        So here we are now... Haymitch told me everything about ahow this works and that it is technically impossible for the capitol to read what I upload here. The couriers that transport my posts for me may be able to <em>upload</em>, but do not have access to it. Well, if he is so sure about this, I will be so, too.
