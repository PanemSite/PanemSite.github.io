        I found him. And Cato did a GREAT job completely destroying his leg. I went back to roughly around where Peeta fought Cato. I knew he injured his leg so he wouldn't be able to move around much and therefor would have to stay near a river or a lake. And I knew there was a river very close. And so I went up the river until I stumbled across some rocks. He wouldn't be able to climb over these but there I also found some bloodstains and followed them. They ended in nowhere, but suddenly I heard a voice under me. And there he was. Completely camouflaged under leaves, branches and dirt.

        Well, I hope it is true and they can't read this here. But I am really, REALLY mad at the capitol. I now understand what Peeta ment when he said "we are just a part of their games. Not individuals". And it is true. They don't care at all, but see us as puppets that do what ever they please for. Long story short - rue is dead. She got trapped by District 1s male tribute and killed with a spear in her stomach. It was a sad and angrying moment. that was when I understood Peetas words. And so I wanted to show that to the viewers and decorated her with flowers and sang her a song before she was picked up. Now I had to go on alone.<br>
        But then the unexpected happened out of nowhere. Claudius Templesmith made an announcement and told us about the first big change in the rules. Now there can be <em>two</em> winners if they are from the same district! I know I HAVE to win for rue and for that I need Peeta. I allready have an Idea where to find him...<br>

        A lot has happened. I went through a firestorm that has injured my hands very hard. Fortunately, I seem to have quite rich sponsors because they sent me some medicine that instantley cured it. That was while I was trapped on a tree with rue. At night we then used my knive to cut of a tracker-jackers nest (Very dangerous wasps, with hallucinating poison) and threw it down to the careers that set up a camp down there. That way I got my hands to a bow and arrows, although I got stung 3 times. But Rue knew some leaves that could cure these stings. An other interesting thing was that Peeta warned me that I should run away from them. I think he somehow wanted to help me. Well, I think they will execute him for that. Rues and my Plan is now to destroy their food supplies, to get them in real trouble. They are from the rich districts, so I doubt they know how to hunger >:)

        Damn. Peeta is with the careers. It seems like they want useful information from him. But hint: never let anyone notive you are discouraged or unsettled or you might immediately

        If you somehow spot a camera, it is very likely that there is an internet acces in form of a small "touch screen" nearby. They seem to share the same cables.<br>
        Back to the actual topic. I highly recommend paying attention when the announcement in the sky about the killed tributes comes. This results a lot of useful information, eg. If you met someone very close to you and he's dead after a short time, you know there are others nearby and you can even figure out who.

        I finally got the possibility to upload my first hints. I almost stumbled over a courierpatrol. They <em>are</em> easy to recognize. So I gave them my first notes what to do when the games start (This text up here is btw written by the courier service).<br>
        It really depends on your personal skills. First I saw a bow and arrows lying around 30 feet away from my position and a small package just a few meters away from me. My first Idea was to grab the bow and run as fast as I can towards the forest. I think this would be a good Idea if you can run fast <em>and</em> are good at face-to-face fights with those hardcore trained killing-machines. As this is not true for me, I immediately grabbed the small package in front of me and ran into the forset. And there you have it again: even if you think some stuff in the middle would be more useful, it's the small things that safe your life. A girl threw a knife after me, but it got stuck in my backpack. Now I've got a perfect weapon without having to go to the middle or the "cornucopia".
