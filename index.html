    <h1>Official website of Panem</h1>

    <div class="maintext">
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to Panems official website! The Hungergames have just started and we set up this site so that tributes can share their experiences to the public without being interviewed, by using our recently implemented blog feature!
        Also, they were told to try their best making notes or some kind of diary about their experiences. That is because we want them to have the possibility to leave some sort of tips and tricks for later games, although we know there won't be much time for this.<br><br>
        Here is how it works:<br>
        Every tribute has been given a little book and pencil that was mounted to their belt.
        They can, if they have time, take some notes of experiences, fights, plants or tricks.
        To share them, they need to find a courier (They will be easy to recognize), who uploads the notes for them.
        The entries on the site are private and encrypted so not even the government can view them. It is up to the tributes whether they want them to go public after their death or win.
